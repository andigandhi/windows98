This is an addition to the wonderful win98 styled css from [jdan](https://github.com/jdan/98.css).

It adds Javascript to move the window divs with the mouse or with touch. It also adds a siteLoader.js to easily build a menu for loading new site links.


## Installation Guide

The installation is easy: Just clone the repository with 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/andigandhi/windows98
```
and open index.html in your browser. You should see the theme with some dummy content.


## Adding content

Content can be added in the /content folder in the form of .html documents.
Every content has to be added to the siteLinks or the icons arrays in /js/siteLoader.js.
